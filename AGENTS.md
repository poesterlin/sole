# Sole contributor and deployment notes

## Checks

- Install web dependencies: `cd web && bun install --frozen-lockfile`
- Web checks/build: `cd web && bun run check && bun run build`
- Generated images: `cd assets && bun run check` (fails when a committed asset no longer matches its master; rebuild with `bun run build`). Replacing the artwork means rebuilding the knockout master first with `python3 assets/make-alpha.py`, which needs Pillow — see `assets/README.md`
- Native clustering: `cargo test --manifest-path clustering-rs/Cargo.toml --locked`
- Cluster naming integration: migrate a disposable PostgreSQL database, then `cd web && TEST_DATABASE_URL=<disposable-url> bun test src/lib/server/cluster-naming.integration.test.ts`
- Radio integration: after migrating a disposable PostgreSQL database, run
  `cd web && TEST_DATABASE_URL=<disposable-url> bun test src/lib/server/radio.integration.test.ts`
  and `TEST_DATABASE_URL=<disposable-url> bun test src/lib/server/playback-settings.integration.test.ts`
  separately. The radio test mocks recommendation output and uses a fake MA
  WebSocket server; its mocks must not leak into other test files.
- Python worker tests: build `embeddings/Dockerfile`, then run `unittest discover` from `embeddings/tests`
- Fresh database: provide a disposable pgvector URL and run `bun run db:migrate && FRESH_DATABASE=1 bun run test:fresh-db`
- Create/reset an account: `bun run auth:create-user --username <name>`
- The authenticated `/settings` page manages scoped Worker and playback API
  keys; secrets are shown once and stored hashed.

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. Never commit the filled file. The host audio
path is `MUSIC_LIBRARY_PATH`; containers see it at `/music`.

The optional `database` Compose profile provides PostgreSQL with pgvector:

```sh
docker compose --profile database up -d postgres
```

External PostgreSQL installations can leave that profile disabled and provide
`DATABASE_URL` directly. When the profile is enabled, keep
`DATABASE_INTERNAL_URL` pointed at the `postgres` service for containers while
`DATABASE_URL` points at the localhost-bound port for host commands.

## Runtime profiles

- Default: web and the API-mode embedding worker, which needs no music mount and
  no database. The maintenance jobs run in-process on `Bun.cron`
  (`$lib/server/scheduler.ts`), which is why the web image pins Bun rather than
  tracking `1`. There is no leader election, so a
  second web replica would run every job; the jobs are idempotent, so that
  wastes work rather than corrupting anything.
- Continuous vibe radio also runs in the web process, checking active sessions
  every 15 seconds. Sessions and bounded recent-track history live in
  `radio_sessions` (migration `0020_continuous_playback`). Keep one web replica:
  radio queue mutation locks are process-local. Radio refills append to the pinned
  MA queue and never resume paused/idle players.
- `embedding`: bounded/manual Python worker runs.
- `clustering`: native Rust benchmark, split, apply, and rollback jobs.

The app uses database-backed user/session authentication. Registration is
opt-in with `ALLOW_REGISTRATION=true` and limited by `MAX_USERS` (default 1);
use `bun run auth:create-user --username <name>` to create or reset an account
within that limit. `WORKER_TOKEN` is limited to the worker and internal jobs;
`PLAYBACK_API_KEY` is limited to the external playback POST. API worker
mode is enabled with `--source-mode api` and `WORKER_URL` plus `WORKER_TOKEN`.
It downloads bounded snippets in a background pool and uploads batches over
HTTP. Cluster apply/rollback and embedding writes are explicit operations.
Read-only status and dry-run commands are safe for diagnostics.

## Deployment

The Compose file expects the external Traefik network (`TRAEFIK_NETWORK`,
default `traefik_web`) and uses the `DOMAIN` variable for routing. The
repository `deploy.sh` runs from a checkout on the deployment machine. It
fetches the configured branch and rebuilds the local Compose stack; use the
Compose workflow directly for a new host.

Before exposing the service, run:

```sh
bun run doctor -- --strict
docker compose config --quiet
```
